  ## Rule 0: Don't be a dick

  Practice common sense while consulting these rules. The general idea counts, not the exact wording. The rules are guidelines for the server and should be interpreted to suit the situation at hand, not manipulated to suit your needs. Attempting to Rules-Lawyer an Administrator is never a good idea, and likely to result in harsher punishment

  The Server Staff retains the right to issue Permanent Bans to players that they consider to be a consistent net negative to the community and server, without the need for any specific Rule to be broken.

  The Staff Members have final say on the server. If you are banned or job banned from the server. Ban appeals will be handled on the Discord.

  The Adminhelp system is not to be spammed. If you do not get a response, the Administrators are either busy with other matters or not available.

  When in doubt, Adminhelp any question you may have about the Server Rules.
