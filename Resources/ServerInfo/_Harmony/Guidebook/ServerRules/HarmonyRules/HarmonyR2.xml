	## Rule 2: SSD Players

	SSD Players are players that have disconnected from the game. They can be identified by examining them, which will reveal yellow text indicating they might return. Players with purple catatonic text can be assumed brain dead and taken to cryosleep or the morgue.

	Do not tamper with SSD players unless necessary. Beneficial interactions (Such as dragging them to a safer area or giving them medical care) are allowed.

	Members of security are allowed to perform arrests and to process people who go SSD in front of them as if they were awake.
