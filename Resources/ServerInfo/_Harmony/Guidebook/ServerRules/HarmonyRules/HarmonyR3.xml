	## Rule 3: Maintaining a Respectful Environment

	Be respectful to everyone. Every character is played by a real human being. Frustration is natural and a part of roleplay, but should not result in you actively harassing anyone.

	Under no circumstances is OOC harassment of another player allowed, regardless of who the victim is.

	Racial, Homophobic, Ethnic, Religious, etc, slurs are not allowed IC or OOC and are strictly prohibited.

	Speciesism is prohibited.

  [color=#a4885c]METAGRUDGING[/color]

	"Metagrudging" refers to the act of negatively treating another player due to a previous experience with them (IC or OOC) such as:

	- Demoting someone immediately shift start.
	- Repeatedly harassing someone IC with little to no reason.
	- Repeatedly telling someone in LOOC or OOC chat that you do not like them.

	Metagrudging is not allowed.

	Continuity with previous rounds is acceptable (such as remembering another character's actions) but it should not result in any negative attention or unreasonable favoritism (Eg. giving out AA because you like someone).
