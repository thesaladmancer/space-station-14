	## Rule 6: Self-Antagging

	"Self-Antagonism" is a highly subjective term which broadly means "Do not make everything worse".

	A few examples of self-antagonistic activities include:

	- Anything which negatively impacts the enjoyment of a large part of the crew, or puts the station at risk.
	- Criminal activity done without reasonable IC justification (AKA doing things "just because you can").
	- Theft of high value items, most notably syndicate objectives.
	- Actively assisting an antagonist just for the sake of it. (Helping antagonists with reasonable cause, such as "Fear RP" or hostage situations, is allowed)
	- Actively diverting security personnel and resources away from other direct threats.
	- Kidnapping or Murder, except as a last resort scenario or during an approved execution.
	- Any form of round removal.

	This list is not exhaustive. If you fear that what you are doing could be self-antagonism, it is recommended to ahelp it.

	Harmony does not allow EORG.

	The round is not over until everyone is returned to the lobby. You are expected to keep following rules and to stay in character.

	This includes antagonists. You may not continue pursuing your objectives during this time.

	When handling a situation, you should not immediately jump to violence at every possible opportunity.

	In general you should only attempt to respond to a situation with equal force to the other party. If you fear that your or someone else's life is in danger, you are allowed to defend yourself.

	Minor assault is allowed with proper IC justification and provocation. Assault without provocation is not allowed.

	Conflicts always end when either participant enters a critical state. You are expected to make sure the critically injured person receives adequate care unless it would be unreasonable for you to do so.
