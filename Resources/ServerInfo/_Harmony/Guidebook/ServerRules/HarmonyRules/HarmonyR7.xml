	## Rule 7: Validhunting

	It is only the job of Security to stop antagonists. If you are not a member of Security, then hunting Antagonists is not something you should be doing.

	You are allowed to defend yourself from antagonists, but should not make extended efforts to chase them down. The captain, while well armed, should not be hunting antagonists and should allow security to take the lead except during emergencies.

	Antagonists which seek to destroy the station itself or kill the entire crew, such as Nuclear Operatives, are exempt from the validhunting rule, as it may require dozens of crew members to stop them. It is however recommended to try to keep doing your job first, as it may save more lives in the end. If a minor antagonist has eliminated all of security (I.E. as a result of DAGD), crew may take more significant action to call evac and/or eliminate the threat until security is revived.
