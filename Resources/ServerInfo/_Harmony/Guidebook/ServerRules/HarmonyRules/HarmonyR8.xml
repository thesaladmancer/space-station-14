	## Rule 8: Erotic Content

	Harmony is a 16+ server, but this does not mean you should be crude.

	Generally, avoid anything that can come off as erotic. Don't say things like, “They're raping me!”. Lighter forms of affection like hugs and kisses are appropriate, as long as they are platonic.

	Sexual terms can be used as insults, such as saying "Go fuck yourself". However, avoid getting into too much detail, and do not harass people. Content that could have implied sexual meaning is subject to admin ruling. [textlink="(See also: Rule 3 - Maintaining a respectful environment)" link="HarmonyR3"]
