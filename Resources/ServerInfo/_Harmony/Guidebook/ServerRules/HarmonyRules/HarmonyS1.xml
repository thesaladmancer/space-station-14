  ## 1S - Follow your laws

  [bold]Silicons must obey ALL their laws at all times, regardless of order or amount. In the case of a direct conflict between two laws, the lowest numbered one takes precedence.[/bold]

  Silicon roles will have additional rules imposed to them, commonly known as laws. They take the form of an ordered list and are accessible in game via the “View laws” action in game.

  Silicon characters must, at all times, obey their laws to the best of their ability. These laws trump game rules, meaning that you are allowed to ignore them if directly told to by the game. However, a lack of indication not to perform an action is not a valid reason to perform said action.

  Whenever possible, silicons must follow all of their laws at once, finding a valid interpretation of these laws to meet the demands if able. If two laws are in direct conflict, or if a silicon is otherwise unable to meet the demands of all their laws simultaneously, they must prioritize the one closer to the top of their ordered list, in ascending law order.
