  ## 2S - Game rules still apply

  [bold]Silicons are bound to the same game rules as crew unless they possess a law which directly states otherwise.[/bold]

  While cyborgs are allowed to bypass game rules if a law they possess allows them to, this does not allow them to ignore rules at all times.

  Silicons are bound to the same rules as crew, most notably concerning self antagonism. Their laws not containing a direct mention not to do something does not constitute a valid reason to do so, and if that something is self-antagonistic in nature, a silicon is subject to punishment just as a regular crewmember would be.

  Actively pursuing antagonists without an explicit reason to do so is considered validhunting. Silicons are not security officers and should not be engaging in their matters.

  Passively allowing a law change or obeying an order to stay still are allowed, but directly requesting a law change to something more “Interesting” or actively following a known syndicate hoping to get e-magged are considered self antagonism and are not permitted.

  Altered or subverted silicons are given more leeway concerning self antagonism. For instance, ion laws may be interpreted in an exaggerated manner as long as doing so does not actively harm the experience of others.
