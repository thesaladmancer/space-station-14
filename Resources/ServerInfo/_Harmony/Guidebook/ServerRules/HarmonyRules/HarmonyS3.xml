  ## 3S - Be consistent

  [bold]Silicons may use their judgement to interpret laws, but said interpretation must be accurate to the wording of the law, and remain the same across time. Crew and Harm are defined terms that cannot be misinterpreted.[/bold]

  The main difference between a server rule and a silicon law is that silicon laws are much more open to being rules lawyered.

  Part of playing silicon is interpreting laws in new and innovative ways, but said interpretation must still be correct. Overzealous law misinterpretations are subject to admin discretion in the same way as failing to follow a law would be.

  Crew and Harm are two common and frequently used terms when it comes to silicon rules. Unless stated otherwise:

  - Crew refers to anyone with a valid crew icon.
  - Harm refers to physical damage to an entity, whether direct or indirect.

  These terms cannot be lawyered, but you are allowed to expand upon their meaning such as considering mental harm a form of harm.

  When picking an interpretation of a law, you must be consistent in that interpretation for the rest of the round.
