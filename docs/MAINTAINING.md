# Harmony Maintainer Guidelines

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

The term PR is to be interpreted as an abbreviation for a pull request to the Harmony repository on the website "GitHub".

For the purposes of this document, maintainers of a specific type of resource (e.g. art) are to be considered separate from the maintainer team.

If a maintainer is unsure of what to do in any situation, they SHOULD ask another maintainer for information and only act after receiving the proper guidance.

## Dealing with Pull Requests

- A maintainer MUST make sure that the PR aligns with the balance intentions of the content curation team.

  If they believe that a PR may not align with the intentions of the content curation team, they MUST post it in the [`#maint-dev`](https://discord.com/channels/1139716325627932682/1401713596500803594) channel for proper consideration and feedback by the rest of the team.

- A maintainer MUST make sure that the PR does not cause any unnecessary trouble to the administration team.

  If a maintainer believes that a PR may cause trouble to the administration team, they MUST post it in the [`#admin-dev`](https://discord.com/channels/1139716325627932682/1324253592634396734) channel for proper feedback

- If a PR involves a change to the rules, it MUST be approved by a Harmony Project Manager.

- A maintainer MUST test the PR to the best of their abilities and make sure that every cited change works correctly.

- A maintainer MUST make sure that the PR does not contain any uncited changes.

- A maintainer MUST make sure that the PR abides by both the [Harmony Contributing Guidelines](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ss14-harmony/ss14-harmony/refs/heads/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and the [Upstream Coding Conventions](https://docs.spacestation14.com/en/general-development/codebase-info/conventions.html).

Anytime a maintainer requests changes to a PR, they must be as explicit and clear as possible. Do not shy away from having a very long message in your requested changes.

A PR MUST NOT be merged until all of the above PR guidelines have been correctly applied.

The only exception is changelog update PRs and the code review for upstream merges.

## Publishing

A maintainer MUST NOT publish code to the server without being explicitly permitted to do so.

## In-Game permissions

A maintainer MAY get in-game permissions.

These permissions are intended for debugging but MAY be used for observing a round.

A maintainer MUST NOT use these permissions in a way that affects other players without explicit approval from an in-game Harmony administrator.
